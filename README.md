# Wall - Frontend
This application is a fun/simple version of a social media "wall", where a user can create posts and have other users provide comments per post. 

This is purely the front-end of the application built usint React. It connects to an API by providing it environment configs.

##### Prereqs:

1. Yarn

##### Installation:

1. Install all needed dependencies with Yarn: 

    ```
    yarn -i
    ```
2. Make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`. This file will contain information to connect to the API.

3. Run your application
    ```
    yarn run start
    ```

###### Note:
Keep in mind that the application will not be fully functional until a established connection with the API is made. The API is located here: https://github.com/diegocam/WallAPI
